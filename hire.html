      <h3>What I like in an organization</h3>
        <div class="hire-me-paragraph">
          I love an organization where <strong>thoughtfulness radiates at every level</strong>. I like to see this balanced with a willingness to act and decide, extreme ownership of failure
          (especially amongst the most senior leaders) and enthusiastic delegation and empowerment of team members. I am and love to see servant leaders who act with and expect their teams to act with integrity.

        <div class="hire-me-paragraph">
          With my deep history of support for product teams of all sizes, <strong>product market fit is something I live and breath</strong>. Your company should have it or be actively in pursuit of it.
          If you haven't found it yet and need support, this is an area I can specifically help with.

      <h3>What I like in a technical team</h3>
        <div class="hire-me-paragraph">
          I love a team that gives a damn. About the business, the product they are building, about the quality of their code, and about each other.

          I love to work with brilliant humans with no ego. I love to see technologists be good humans towards each another, great collaborators for their product partners, and pragmatic but courageous in their technical decisions.

          I love to see technical decisions paired appropriately with company stage and product maturity. I get excited to hear brilliant individuals describe their solutions in terms of its strengths AND weaknesses and look for feedback on mitigating downsides.

          Which brings me to feedback. I love a team that is good at feedback -- that seeks it out.
