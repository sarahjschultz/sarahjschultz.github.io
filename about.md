### About This Project

This is the webiverse of Sarah Schultz.

In 2013, Sarah was in a scooter accident.  Recovering from this accident was tremendously boring and tedious. 
This site was born out of that downtime and has been mostly a hacking ground to test out ideas. 

Suffice to say, it has...evolved.
 
Here is the evolution in GIF form:

She works as a full-stack engineer at [ProductPlan](www.productplan.com) and likes to talk to people and laugh at jokes.

She also occasionally updates the blog on this site called Things I Did Wrong.  TIDW is a manifesto of mistake-making, and helpful reminders about how to not make those mistakes again.  This is likely very useless for you.

### Contact

You can reach Sarah through various paths [all found on the homepage]({{ site.baseurl }}/).
