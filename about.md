### About This Project

This is the webiverse of Sarah Schultz, person of interest.

In 2013, Sarah was in a scooter accident, while living in San Francisco.

Recovering from this accident was tremendously boring and tedious, so she took the opportunity to finally read all the Ruby and Rails books she had been hoarding.  She now works as a developer and likes to talk to people and laugh at jokes.

She also occasionally updates the blog on this site, called Things I Did Wrong.  TIDW is a manifesto of mistake-making, and helpful reminders about how to not make those mistakes again.  This is likely very useless for you.

### Contact

You can reach Sarah through various paths [back on the homepage]({{ site.baseurl }}/).
