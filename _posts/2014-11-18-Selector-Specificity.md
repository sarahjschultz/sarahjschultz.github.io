title: Selector Specificity

CSS and I are in a fight and it is my fault because I did not know that classes were more specific selectors than HTML tags and so rules set on a class will always overwrite rules set on a tag.

Unless of course you happen to invoke one of ANY OTHER MILLION TRICK RULES THAT CSS IS HIDING FROM YOU.

Guess what my face looks like right now.
