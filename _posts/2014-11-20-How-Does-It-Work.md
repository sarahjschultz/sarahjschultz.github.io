title: How Does It Work!
---

The easiest way to tell if a thing is working is if it just works.

I wish I had something more profound to say about this, but I don't. Sometimes it can be really difficult to determine if a thing is working the way that you want. Sometimes it can be equally difficult to tell why a thing is not working.

If and Why, though, are really distinct questions.

Today the thing that I did wrong, was convolute the two, and got really deep in Chef Docs, trying to understand how I could know if the cookbook I had loaded, was actually working.

All I had to do to tell IF it was working, was SSH into the dev machine it was running on, and look for the files.

Instead, I lost brain cells trying to make sense of Chef documentation -- which I assure you -- is some of the most difficult documentation I've ever tried to make sense of.
