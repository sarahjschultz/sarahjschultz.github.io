So I built my first React component. Except -- key point -- it didn't work. Like really didn't work. Laughably didn't work. It didn't even obviously fail -- which would have been better -- it silently failed.

And when I say silently failed, I mean: the page rendered, the existing page components rendered, and there were no JS errors anywhere. The only indication that the component wasn't working was that it literally wasn't present on the page.

After some debugging with a colleague, he determined that the issue was about VARIABLES. Namely, the things I was setting in this new component, weren't available
