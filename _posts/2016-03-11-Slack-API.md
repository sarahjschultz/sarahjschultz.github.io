title: Slack API
---

I am StackOverflowing. I am GitHubbing. But the best/worst part of this open-source month is that I am building a bot to handle invites for the Ruby Group I help organize.  

Our [Ruby group](http://denverrubychicks.github.io) uses Slack to stay in touch -- but manually inviting people you don't know to a Slack group is actually kind of arduous.  
Enter the Slack API.  It's a pretty trivial task to spin up an app that manages your invites -- at least, in theory.  

But their docs are rough -- and I know what you're going to say:  YOU FIX IT! THIS IS A DO-OCRACY!  And you're right. 

Except, their repository is NOT open source, so I had to settle for submitting an issue to their Issue Queue. 
  
Anyway, InviteBot is taking a lot of time, and blogging gets a back seat.
