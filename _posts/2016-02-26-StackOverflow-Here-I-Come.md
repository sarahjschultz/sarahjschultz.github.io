title: Stack Overflow Here I Come
---

It is Day 2 of Do-Ocracy challenge, and today I decided I was still too freaked out to do anything on GitHub **BUT**
I could comment on StackOverflow.  

So I found a recent question about upgrading a Rails 3 app to Rails 4, which is a project we have recently undertaken  
on my own team. SO GUESS WHO HAD A WEALTH OF THINGS TO SHARE???  

That's right: me. 

Anyway, I answered it and I refuse to read what happens afterward.  

Hello internet, I've arrived.
